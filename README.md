ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Stephen Fletcher. After a career in x-ray hardware development - where I was troubleshooter-in-chief for a large high tech engineering firm - I chose to switch domain to software development. Over the years I've built some very transferable knowledge and skills: in product design and development, customer service, fault-finding and diagnosis, team-working, coaching, management and leadership. So I'm far from starting from scratch. 

ðŸŒ±  Since making that desicion I have completed a 12 week bootcamp at Makers https://makers.tech/ to improve my software development skills in a team based environment covering topics such as:
 * Git / Github
 * Test Driven Development
 * Agile, Slack, Trello, Miro, Excalidraw
 * Web apps and APIs
 * Ruby, rspec, rubocop, Sinatra
 * Javascript, jest, ESlint, node, Express, Cypress
 * Phaser
 
Iâ€™ve also built a small web app using Python 3, Django, HTML and CSS and have used OAUTH2 for one of my personal home automation projects. I've grown my understanding of common web security risks (e.g. OWASP Top 10).

ðŸ‘€ I plan to leverage in the world of software the superpowers I developed for hardware: test design, debugging and remediation in complex and tightly coupled systems. Right now though, my priority is increasing my exposure to new, diverse challenges so I can be delivering value whilst growing professionally.
