## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Stephen Fletcher. After a career in x-ray hardware development - where I was troubleshooter-in-chief for a large high tech engineering firm - I chose to switch domain to software development. Over the years I've built some very transferable knowledge and skills: in product design and development, customer service, fault-finding and diagnosis, team-working, coaching, management and leadership. So I'm far from starting from scratch. 

## Makers Bootcamp

ðŸŒ±  Since making that desicion I have completed a 12 week bootcamp at Makers https://github.com/makersacademy to improve my software development skills in a team based environment covering these key aspects of development:

### Bootcamp Final Project
* I was in a team of 5 who developed a 2D sidescroller Phaser game from scratch, deployed Heroku here: https://reefrunner.herokuapp.com.
* The game development repo can be found here: https://github.com/naomischlosser/team-sea-urchins

### Tools

* Git / Github, including forking, cloning, branches, and merge conflicts
* Command line to set up projects and control git
* VScode including liveshare and git merge editor
* Slack, Trello, Miro, Excalidraw as team tools
* Tableplus

### Processes

 * Agile developemnt
 * The 'Golden Square' of
     * Test Driven Development
     * Object Oriented Design
     * Debugging
     * Paired Programming

### Languages
* Ruby, Javascript (ES6), Python, and SQL

### Testing
* Unit tests and Integration tests
* RSpec
* RuboCop
* Jest
* ESLint
* Mocking in both RSpec and Jest for peer classes, API requests and terminal IO
* Cypress for end-top-end testing

### Web apps
* BnB web app based on Sinatra and Embedded Ruby (ERB), deployed to Heroku
* Social media web app based on Express, Node, Javascript, HBS, and MongoDB

### Databases
* PostgreSQL controlled using Ruby repository classes
* MongoDB with Javascript controller

## Python and Django
 
Before the Makers bootcamp I built a small web app using Python 3, Django, HTML and CSS. I've also used OAUTH2 for one of my personal home automation projects and have grown my understanding of common web security risks (e.g. OWASP Top 10).

I also deployed a simple mobile first CV (HTML and Javascript) using python anywhere.

## Finally

ðŸ‘€ I plan to leverage in the world of software the superpowers I developed for hardware: test design, debugging and remediation in complex and tightly coupled systems. Right now though, my priority is increasing my exposure to new, diverse challenges so I can be delivering value whilst growing professionally.
