ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Stephen Fletcher. After a career in x-ray hardware development - where I was troubleshooter-in-chief for a large high tech engineering firm - I chose to switch domain to software development. Over the years I've built some very transferable knowledge and skills: in product design and development, customer service, fault-finding and diagnosis, team-working, coaching, management and leadership. So I'm far from starting from scratch. 

ðŸŒ±  Since making that decision Iâ€™ve worked assiduously to fill the remaining knowledge and skill gaps. For back-end development Iâ€™ve learned and am building using Python 3, Django, and Ruby. Iâ€™ve been versioning using Git - Iâ€™ve also practiced working with APIs and OAUTH for one of my personal home automation projects; and grown my understanding of common web security risks (e.g. OWASP Top 10). In my most recent project - a responsive web app - Iâ€™ve been using semantic mark-up and Iâ€™m currently working with a UX designer the product accessibility baked in. This has meant learning enough HTML and CSS to enhance what Django offers out of the box.

ðŸ‘€ I plan to leverage in the world of software the superpowers I developed for hardware: test design, debugging and remediation in complex and tightly coupled systems. Right now though, my priority is increasing my exposure to new, diverse challenges so I can be delivering value whilst growing professionally.
