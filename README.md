## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Stephen Fletcher. After a career in x-ray hardware development - where I was troubleshooter-in-chief for a large high tech engineering firm - I chose to switch domain to software development. Over the years I've built some very transferable knowledge and skills: in product design and development, customer service, fault-finding and diagnosis, team-working, coaching, management and leadership. So I'm far from starting from scratch. 

## Makers Bootcamp

ðŸŒ±  Since making that desicion I have completed a 12 week bootcamp at Makers https://github.com/makersacademy to improve my software development skills in a team based environment covering these aspects of development:

 * Git / Github, including forking, cloning, branches, and merge conflicts
 * Agile developemnt process
 * Command line 
 * Slack, Trello, Miro, Excalidraw as team tools
 * The 'Golden Square' of Test Driven Development, Object Oriented Design, Debugging, and Paired Programming
 * Ruby, RSpec for unit testing including mocks for peer classes, API requests and terminal IO.
 * Integration tests, and Rubocop linter
 * PostgreSql and Ruby repository classes
 * Sinatra and Embedded Ruby (ERB) app deployed to Heroku
 * Javascript (ES6), unit testing with Jest including mocking API response, and ESlint for code quality
 * Async Javascript, fetch, promises, DOM manipulation, forms, frontend control
 * Express, Node, Javascript app using MongoDB, and Cypress for end-to-end testing
 * 2D sidescroller Phaser game created from scratch and deployed to Heroku

## Python /Django
 
Iâ€™ve also built a small web app using Python 3, Django, HTML and CSS and have used OAUTH2 for one of my personal home automation projects. I've grown my understanding of common web security risks (e.g. OWASP Top 10).

I have also deployed a simple mobile first CV (HTML and Javascript) using python anywhere.

## Finally

ðŸ‘€ I plan to leverage in the world of software the superpowers I developed for hardware: test design, debugging and remediation in complex and tightly coupled systems. Right now though, my priority is increasing my exposure to new, diverse challenges so I can be delivering value whilst growing professionally.
