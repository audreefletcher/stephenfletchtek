👋 Hi, I’m Stephen Fletcher. After a career in high voltage hardware R&D, I’ve decided to switch domain to software development. I don’t see it as starting entirely from scratch because as well as developing hardware in that time I built some very transferable knowledge and skills: in product design and development, customer service, fault-finding and diagnosis, team-working, coaching, management and leadership. 

👀 I’m interested most in Python, data science and back-end engineering opportunities - collaborations/volunteering, trainee and junior positions for now. I’m highly motivated, and already have great people skills and a high EQ - something I know some devs never really develop - so I’m looking forward to working in multidisciplinary teams.

🌱 I’m currently learning Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript - with Ruby next in the list. I’m building a foundation as a passable full-stack developer before going much, much deeper on Python and data.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really within this stack. I need briefs, as I learn best through practical application, and I need to develop the workflow habits associated with collaborating with others on code. So want someone to work with on your side hustle for a while? Hit me up.
