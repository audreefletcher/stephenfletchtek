## 👋 Hi, I’m Stephen Fletcher

💻 After a career in x-ray hardware development - where I was troubleshooter-in-chief for a large high tech engineering firm - I chose to switch domain to software development. Over the years I've built some very transferable knowledge and skills: in product design and development, customer service, fault-finding and diagnosis, team-working, coaching, management and leadership.

🌱 Since moving away from hardware I have completed a bootcamp at [Makers](https://github.com/makersacademy) to improve my skills in a team based environment covering many key areas of software development.

⚙️ Before Makers I worked assiduously to fill knowledge and skill gaps. For back-end development I built a web app using Python 3, and Django. I also practiced working with APIs and OAuth 2.0 for one of my personal home automation projects; and have grown my understanding of common web security risks (e.g. OWASP Top 10).

👀 I plan to leverage in the world of software the superpowers I developed for hardware: test design, debugging and remediation in complex and tightly coupled systems. Right now though, my priority is increasing my exposure to new, diverse challenges so I can be delivering value whilst growing professionally.
